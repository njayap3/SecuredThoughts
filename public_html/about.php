						I am Neha Jayaprakash and I am a "codoholic" (No! I don't play COD games according to Urban Dictionary), I JUST LOVE 
						TO CODE (probably "coderholic" is more appropriate). Well, I recently graduated from UIC and currently working as a Web Application Developer-Full Stack at Exact Sports. 
						As I am a night owl, I decided to start this website in order kill those few extra hours in a day and to keep myself occupied and increase my learning curve.
						I love to work on challenging problems and keep myself updated with the latest technologies.

						Good question! We all know, how vulnearble our internet is. There is always some kind of attack at some corner of
						the world. My goal is to understand the depth and breath of web development and to contribute in the field of
						web security. So please feel free to share any kind of "Secured Thoughts" you have regarding web security. It goes without saying that,
						I will also post/share any interesting facts that I come across.
